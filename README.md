# tax-calculator

This was a coding challenge and an attempt at a flex, not necesseeraily a good program

I used this site as a refrence for the threshold tables https://www.superguide.com.au/how-super-works/income-tax-rates-brackets



To use the tool, please navigate to the folder with your desired tool (command line, api, front end) and run:

``sudo docker build -t tax_calculator --rm . && sudo docker run -it --name tax_calculator --rm tax_calculator``
